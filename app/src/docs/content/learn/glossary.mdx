#### Data Union
A Data Union framework provides a way to collect and package an individuals's real-time data together with others' with rich consent and while distributing a fair share of the revenue back to the users when someone pays to access it.

#### Gap fill
Gap fill is a the mechanism of requesting resends of missing messages in a message chain to help achieve delivery completeness. Messages in Streamr streams are chained, allowing for gap detection (detecting missing messages). For example, the client may receive the following sequence (simplified):
- Message 1: Previous message was null
- Message 2: Previous message was Message 1
- Message 5: Previous message was Message 4

The client can now detect that they missed one or more messages that came after Message 2 but before Message 5. They do a "gap fill" to fill the gap, i.e. request a resend of messages from Message 2 (exclusive) up to Message 4 (inclusive).
