# Use Cases
Streams implement a publish-subscribe paradigm, or pub/sub for short. A stream can receive data from many sources (or publishers), and there can be several listeners who subscribe to a stream. There are several variations on the possible pub/sub topologies, such as many-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. Streamr supports all of these.

These are just a few examples. There is virtually no limit on the kind, format, or quantity of data you can feed into Streamr, even digital images, streaming video, or other domain-specific data could be pushed into a stream.
