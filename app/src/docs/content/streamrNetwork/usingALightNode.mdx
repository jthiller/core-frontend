# Using a light node

Light nodes are Streamr nodes that run locally as part of your application instance. You use it exactly like any other library: you import it to your application and interface with it using function calls.

The Streamr light node is packaged as a JavaScript library. It runs in Node.js as well as the browser. If you're developing in a programming language other than JS, <Link to={docsLinks.installingABrokerNode}>run a Broker node</Link> instead and <Link to={docsLinks.connectingApplications}>connect your application</Link> to it.

## Importing a light node

The `StreamrClient` library wraps a light node, which the library uses for publishing and subscribing to data. The library is available on `npm` as package `streamr-client`. This article contains quick usage instructions, but for more detailed instructions please refer to the [streamr-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/streamr-client) library itself.

Install the library using `npm`:

```
npm install streamr-client
```

When using Node.js, import the library with:

```
import { StreamrClient } from 'streamr-client'
```

Create an instance of `StreamrClient`, authenticated with an Ethereum private key:

### Subscribing to real-time messages in a stream

By subscribing to a <Link to={docsLinks.streams}>stream</Link>, your application gets immediately notified about new messages in the stream.

### Publishing messages to streams

When you publish messages to a stream, they get delivered by the peer-to-peer network to all subscribing nodes.

<CodeSnippet language="javascript">{PublishJavascriptClient}</CodeSnippet>

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the [streamr-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/streamr-client) library itself.

## Staying safe

Don't share your private key to anyone. If someone gets access to it, they can publish and subscribe as you, and steal any tokens you might have in that wallet! Read more about <Link to={docsLinks.identity}>identity, keys, and wallets</Link>.
